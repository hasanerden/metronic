## Metronic

Metronic now offers two distinct versions:

- **Metronic 8.x**: Built on Bootstrap, this version will continue to receive updates, including third-party plugin updates, bug fixes, and improvements.
- **Metronic 9.x**: Built on Tailwind CSS, this version represents our long-term direction as Tailwind CSS is becoming the de facto UI framework.

## Metronic 8.x Bootstrap Packages:

Due to the increasing package size, now reaching 10GB, the Metronic v8.x package has been separated. It is now available for download from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwbYBjaC3lAmV2R0MUpORTVlaXM?resourcekey=0-9YjRuZtzdAyXLhWa9IAciQ&usp=drive_link), and from the [Metronic Downloads site](https://devs.keenthemes.com/metronic), which requires a purchase code to download individual features.
